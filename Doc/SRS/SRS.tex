\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Executable HTML file will launch in a new web browser window.    \subitem
    Fit Criterion or Test Case: \\
    Check if a new tab opens within the web browser when aforementioned HTML file is executed.    
    \item
    The HTML will be executable by any browser with JavaScript compatibility.    \subitem
    Fit Criterion or Test Case: \\
    Execute the HTML file with different major browsers and check if it executes properly.    
    \item
    Initial condition of the game will display a start menu and stay in a standby sate until it receives user input.    \subitem
    Fit Criterion or Test Case: \\
    Check that the game stays in the start menu when executed until it receives an input.    
    \item
    When the game starts the game state will have zero blocks within the grid and score will be set to zero.    \subitem
    Fit Criterion or Test Case: \\
    Check the display of the grid and scoreboard when begin game to check is score is at 0 and no blocks are in the grid.    
    \item
    Blocks will start flowing one by one onto the grid and will rotate based upon user input when the user pushed the play game button.    \subitem
    Fit Criterion or Test Case: \\
    Click play on the game and check that the blocks begin flow onto grid one by one and input the WASD keys to check for the 90-degree rotation.    
    \item
    During the game if a block lands outside of the grid of the game then the game will terminate and display final score to the user.    \subitem
    Fit Criterion or Test Case: \\
    Check that the game returns the users final score and displays the game over screen.    
    \end{itemize}
