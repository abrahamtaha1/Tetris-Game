\section{Team Meeting Plan}
AAA Solutions plans to meet through discord server once a week on Fridays at 3:30pm Eastern Standard Time for a 30 minutes period of time. However, on weeks in which there is a deliverable due we will also meet Tuesdays at 4:30pm Eastern Standard Time for a period of 30 minutes. During these weekly meeting Andrew Carvalino will be the scribe and is in charge of keeping a record of the meeting. The meeting chair will alternate between Abdallah Taha and Ali Tabar. Each week we will alternate responsibility of writing down a statement of decisons made for the upcoming week. 

\section{Team Communication Plan}
AAA Solution will use primarily Discord for our main source of communication however we will also use Facebook Messenger. When individually working on a deliverable it will be common practice to include commit messages through git to inform other team members on the progress that has been achieved.
